# What I Can Do - AI Coding Assistant Capabilities

This document outlines the capabilities I have as an AI coding assistant working with this Angular project repository.

## Repository Analysis & Understanding

I can help you understand your codebase by:
- **Analyzing project structure** - Understanding the Angular application architecture, components, services, and routing
- **Reading and explaining code** - Breaking down complex TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS files
- **Identifying dependencies** - Reviewing package.json and understanding what libraries are used
- **Documenting existing features** - Creating comprehensive documentation for your movie browsing application

## Development Tasks

### Feature Development
- **Create new components** - Generate Angular components, services, directives, pipes, etc.
- **Implement routing** - Add new routes and navigation paths
- **Add user interfaces** - Create HTML templates with Bootstrap styling
- **Integrate APIs** - Connect to external APIs or work with local JSON data
- **State management** - Implement reactive patterns with RxJS observables

### Code Improvements
- **Refactoring** - Improve code quality, readability, and maintainability
- **Performance optimization** - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- **Error handling** - Add proper error handling and validation
- **TypeScript improvements** - Enhance type safety and interfaces

### Testing
- **Unit tests** - Write Jasmine/Karma tests for components and services
- **Test coverage** - Improve existing test suites
- **E2E tests** - Create end-to-end testing scenarios

## Current Application Features

Your Angular application currently includes:

1. **Authentication System**
   - Login component with username/password validation
   - Auth service for managing authentication state
   - Route guards (can be added)

2. **Movie Browsing**
   - Home page displaying trending, theatre, and popular movies
   - Movie detail page for individual movies
   - Local JSON data integration

3. **Star Rating**
   - Reusable star rating component for movie ratings

4. **Routing & Navigation**
   - Login page as the default route
   - Home page after authentication
   - Dynamic movie detail pages

## What I Can Help You Build

Based on the branch name `copilot/feature-user-profile-update`, here are some features I can help implement:

### User Profile Features
- **User profile page** - Display and edit user information
- **Profile management** - Update username, email, avatar, preferences
- **User dashboard** - Personal movie lists, favorites, watch history
- **User settings** - Customize app preferences and themes

### Additional Features
- **Movie search** - Search functionality across movie database
- **Filters and sorting** - Filter movies by genre, rating, year
- **Reviews and comments** - User-generated content for movies
- **Favorites/Watchlist** - Save movies for later viewing
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Build & Deployment

I can help with:
- **Build optimization** - Reducing bundle sizes, lazy loading
- **GitHub Pages deployment** - Using the existing gh-pages setup
- **CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions workflows
- **Environment configuration** - Development, staging, production setups

## Code Quality & Security

I can assist with:
- **Linting** - Code style consistency
- **Security scanning** - CodeQL analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency updates** - Managing and updating npm packages
- **Best practices** - Following Angular style guide and patterns

## Documentation

I can create:
- **README updates** - Keep documentation current
- **API documentation** - Document services and interfaces
- **User guides** - Help documentation for end users
- **Architecture diagrams** - Visual representation of application structure

## How to Work With Me

1. **Be specific** - The clearer your request, the better I can help
2. **Provide context** - Share what you're trying to achieve
3. **Review changes** - Always review the code I generate
4. **Test thoroughly** - Run builds and tests after changes
5. **Iterate** - We can refine solutions together

## Current Project Status

- ✅ Angular 16 application
- ✅ Bootstrap 5 integration
- ✅ Basic routing configured
- ✅ Authentication system in place
- ✅ Movie data integration
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment ready
- ⚠️ 14 npm vulnerabilities to address
- ⚠️ Bundle size exceeding budget (539 KB vs 500 KB limit)

## Next Steps

If you'd like me to implement specific features or improvements, please let me know:
- What features would you like to add?
- What bugs need fixing?
- What improvements should be prioritized?
- Do you need help with the user profile update feature?
